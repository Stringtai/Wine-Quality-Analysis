Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ This is a Python script I made that analyzes data from "winequality-red.csv" to create charts, scatter plots, and other visualizations. It helps us see how different factors like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol, and sulfur levels affects the overall quality of wine. 
By looking at these charts we can understand what makes some wines better than others. Hope you find it interesting!
